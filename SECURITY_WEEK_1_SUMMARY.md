# Week 1 Security & Infrastructure Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Secure Dependency Updates and Audit
- [x] Executed npm audit and identified vulnerabilities
- [x] Created security-report.md template for documenting findings
- [x] Updated package.json with security-focused dependencies
- [x] Implemented proper dependency management practices

### 2. Environment Configuration
- [x] Created comprehensive `.env.example` file with all required variables
- [x] Added IPFS backend feature flag (`IPFS_BACKEND=helia|legacy`)
- [x] Configured environment variable validation

### 3. Husky Pre-commit Hooks
- [x] Installed Husky as dev dependency
- [x] Created `.husky/pre-commit` hook with lint, type-check, test, and secret-scan
- [x] Integrated with existing secret scanning scripts
- [x] Enabled automatic pre-commit validation

### 4. CI Pipeline Standardization
- [x] Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to standard checks
- [x] Implemented Node.js version matrix (18.x/20.x)
- [x] Added caching for npm dependencies
- [x] Standardized job sequence: install → lint → type-check → test → build
- [x] Integrated security scanning in CI

### 5. IPFS Migration to Helia
- [x] Created `src/lib/ipfs-helia-adapter.ts` with Helia implementation
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility with existing IPFS API
- [x] Implemented feature flag (`IPFS_BACKEND`) for seamless transition
- [x] Preserved all existing IPFS functionality while adding Helia support

### 6. Testing Coverage
- [x] Created unit test file for Helia adapter functions
- [x] Ensured test coverage for new IPFS adapter
- [x] Verified proper test structure for future expansion

### 7. Secret Scanning Integration
- [x] Enhanced pre-commit hooks with secret scanning
- [x] Integrated existing `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` with Husky
- [x] Verified CI pipeline includes secret scanning

### 8. Documentation Updates
- [x] Updated `README_2025_PLAN.md` with quickstart guide
- [x] Added security report template (`docs/security-report-template.md`)
- [x] Documented new IPFS backend switching capability
- [x] Updated Husky/CI behavior documentation

### 9. Quality Assurance
- [x] Verified all new configurations work locally
- [x] Confirmed development server runs on port 3000
- [x] Tested key pages load correctly
- [x] Validated no regressions in existing functionality

### 10. Risk Management & Rollback Strategy
- [x] Documented potential breaking changes from npm audit fix
- [x] Specified Helia compatibility requirements
- [x] Defined rollback procedures for dependencies
- [x] Established IPFS backend rollback option (`IPFS_BACKEND=legacy`)
