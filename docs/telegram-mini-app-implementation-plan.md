# Telegram Mini App Implementation Plan - TON-First Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Telegram Mini App using the TON-first strategy, based on the comparative analysis. The plan follows a structured approach with specific milestones and deliverables.

## Phase 0: Proof of Concept (1-2 days)

### Objective
Validate the TON integration approach and ensure technical feasibility before full-scale development.

### Steps
1. **Setup Environment**
   - Install Node.js 18+ and npm

   - Create a new directory for the PoC

2. **Clone TON Boilerplate**
   ```bash
   npx degit ton-community/ton-stars-boilerplate poc-ton
   cd poc-ton
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Create `.env` file based on `.env.example`
   - Set up basic configuration for local development

4. **Implement Basic TON Connect Integration**
   - Set up `@tonconnect/ui-react`
   - Create simple connection button
   - Test wallet connection in browser

5. **Create Simple Smart Contract**
   - Write basic FunC contract for NFT purchase simulation
   - Deploy to TON testnet using blueprint
   - Test transaction sending

6. **Validate Full Flow**
   - Test authentication via Telegram
   - Test wallet connection
   - Test transaction flow
   - Document any issues or blockers
